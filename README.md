# Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Project

### Problem Statement
- The challenge was to determine the most efficient production method (batch or continuous) for creating paper boats within a 20-minute timeframe, ensuring precision in dimensions and maximizing profitability.
- The project required strict adherence to design specifications, with a sail height of 10 ± 2 mm and a window diameter of 30 ± 2 mm.

### Define Phase
- **Project Charter**: Established the project scope, objectives, and team roles. Defined the problem statement and project goals.
- **Voice of the Customer (VOC)**: Gathered customer requirements and expectations for the paper boats.
- **High-Level Process Map**: Created a SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers) diagram to understand the production process.

### Measure Phase
- **Data Collection Plan**: Developed a plan to collect data on production times, defect rates, and dimensional accuracy for both batch and continuous methods.
- **Measurement System Analysis**: Ensured measurement accuracy and consistency through Gauge R&R studies.
- **Baseline Performance**: Collected initial data to establish the current state of production performance.

### Analyze Phase
- **Process Mapping**: Detailed the process steps for both production methods to identify potential areas of waste and inefficiency.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Used tools such as Fishbone Diagrams and 5 Whys to identify the root causes of defects and inefficiencies.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted statistical analysis to compare the performance of batch and continuous production methods.

### Improve Phase
- **Solution Development**: Brainstormed potential improvements and selected the most feasible solutions based on impact and ease of implementation.
- **Pilot Testing**: Implemented the selected solutions on a small scale to test their effectiveness.
- **Process Optimization**: Adjusted the production process based on pilot test results to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

### Control Phase
- **Control Plan**: Developed a plan to monitor the improved process and ensure sustained performance.
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Updated SOPs to reflect the new process and ensure consistency.
- **Training**: Provided training to production staff on the new process and best practices.
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Established key performance indicators (KPIs) and a reporting system to track ongoing performance.

### Results
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Successfully identified the most efficient production method for creating paper boats.
- **Dimensional Accuracy**: Achieved precision in dimensions, meeting the project specifications for sail height and window diameter.
- **Profitability**: Enhanced the profitability of the paper boat production process by optimizing production methods and reducing waste.
